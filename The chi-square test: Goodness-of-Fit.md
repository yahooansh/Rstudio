#  The chi-square test: Goodness-of-Fit 
Joe owns an auto repair franchises in North America. He wants to know which days of the week his employees are absent in a five-day work week.
Joe would like to believe that employee absence has an even distribution from Monday through Friday. Suppose a random sample of 500 employee were asked on which day of the week they had the highest number of employee absences.
Joe wants to use these results to carry out a, goodness-of-fit test to determine if the absences occur with equal frequencies during a five-day work week?
Test at a 5% significance level.
