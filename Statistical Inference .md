#  Statistical Inference 
With data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, the Public Health 
Agency of Canada reported that 40% of Canadian aged 18 years or older had health 
insurance in 2015. 
On May 1, 2020, the National Centre for Disease Control released results of a poll 
in which 372 of 1004 Canadians aged 18 years or older stated that they had a health 
insurance. Does the evidence suggest at the Î± = 0.05 significance level that the 
proportion of Canadians aged 18 years or older having a health insurance is 
significantly lower in 2020 than the 2015 proportion?
